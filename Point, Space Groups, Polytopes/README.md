# Point, Space Groups, Polytopes

## Rotation Reflection - Matrices Groups Polytopes
Has:
- Rotation and reflection matrices in 1, 2, 3, and 4 dimensions
- Quaternions
- Rotation and reflection groups
- Regular polytopes (polygons, polyhedra, ...)
- Flat-space tilings

## Point and Space Group Demos
Has demos of:
- Point and space groups as symmetries of shapes
- Image tiler
- Plane tilings for all curvatures: positive (sphere), zero (plane), and negative (hyperbolic plane). Polyhedra are tilings of a sphere.

## Polyhedron Colored Vertex Configurations
Give a color to each vertex of a regular polyhedron, with some number of vertices having the same color. To within rotations and reflections, what configurations of vertex colors are there?

## Invariant Tensors of Groups	
These are tensors that are invariant under the action of rotation and reflection groups. A tensor is a generalization to multiple indices of scalars (no indices) and vectors (one index).

These tensors appear in various physical contexts, like four-index ones for stress-strain and ferromagnetism.

## Number of Lattice Space Groups
A space group is a point group with shifts of position (offsets, translations) added. A point group is a group of rotations and/or reflections. A lattice space group has the shifts restricted to a lattice, like in a tiling or a crystal. This restriction constrains what point groups are possible, since the rotations and reflections must preserve the lattice.

This notebook has numbers from [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org/) for how many space groups there are for each number of dimensions of the space that they reside in, along with numbers for properties of these groups, like what kind of lattice and what associated point group.
